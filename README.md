Iris is an application that allows users to self-administer several common ophthalmic diagnostic tests from home. Users can check visual acuity and color recognition, and are able to save their results in order to track changes over time. Currently, Iris is run on Sinatra and PostreSQL; however, a Rails version is coming soon. Stay posted!

Note: The application is best used on larger screens, and Bluetooth keyboards make checking visual acuity much more convenient.
